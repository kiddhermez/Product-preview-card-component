## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### üéìWhat I learned

The first learn that I get was the use of flex-box with his properties like:

```css
.info {
  padding: 25px;
  width: 350px;
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column wrap;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

with this project I also learn the use of media querys:

```css
@media (max-width: 425px) {
  body {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .container {
    width: 90vw;
    height: 100vh;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  }

  .image {
    background-image: url("/images/image-product-mobile.jpg");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
  }
}
```
